# Using Rmarkdown

Create a heading by using a `#` followed by a space then the Heading. Don't forget the space after the `#` 

## subheading


*Italics* can be created by surrounding the text with `*`s 

**Bold** can be created by surrounding text with two `*`s

***You need to knit your changes before committing them to GitHub!***
